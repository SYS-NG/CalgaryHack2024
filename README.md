## VerbalQuest: Elevate Your Social Prowess
ðŸŒŸ Welcome to VerbalQuest, an innovative platform designed to enhance your social interaction skills through AI-powered analytics and personalized feedback. Engage in interactive 'battles' within simulated scenarios, accumulate experience points, and turn every interaction into a learning opportunity. VerbalQuest isn't just preparation; it's the evolution of your social prowess, and continuing to grow in a world with "limited space" for improvement.

## What it does
VerbalQuest employs machine learning to capture social interaction qualities, including eye movements, blinking, facial emotion, and speech patterns. Users receive ratings based on attributes such as attentiveness, confidence, empathy, sociability, and expressiveness. The platform gamifies the experience with a scoring system, allowing users to track their improvement over time. GPT provides customized feedback to aid users in their growth journey. Sign up to maintain progress and consistently evolve your social skills!

## How we built it
- Frontend: React
- Authentication: Firebase/Firestore
- Speech Emotion Models: Neural Networks/Tensorflow
- Language Models: GPT API

## Challenges we ran into
- Long training times for machine learning models
- Integrating numerous components in a short timeframe

## Accomplishments we're proud of
- Exploring Speech Emotion Recognition in machine learning
- Implementing various computer vision applications: blink detection, eye tracking, facial emotion detection
- Planning and building a project with real-world applications

## What we learned
- Quick decision-making and bias toward action
- Challenges and potential of audio-based machine learning
- Complexity of math-heavy computer vision and data processing

## What's next for VerbalQuest
We are an optimistic team aiming to release a prototype with additional features. Future steps include analyzing text and identifying emotion fluctuations during sessions. Join us on this journey of continuous improvement and social growth!
